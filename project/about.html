                        <p>I'm just Federick Gonzalez, and I'm currently a 17 year old student. I go to TERRA Environmental Research Institute, but I graduate on June 4th, 2018, so I can't say I go there for much longer. Once I graduate, I'll be free to say I'm a student of Columbia University!</p>
                        <p>
                        I applied to Columbia through the Early Decision program, and I recieved my decision on December 14th, 2017. Ever since then, I've counted myself lucky that I applied early, because practically everyone else was worrying where they will go to college, while I already knew. I'm a proud Columbia Lion, and I've been accepted to the Fu Foundation <span id="SEAS">School of Engineering and Applied Science</span>, also known as SEAS.</p>
