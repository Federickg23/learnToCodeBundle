                        <p>This is my site, and I just created it using CSS3 and HTML5. This took two days to code and over 200 lines. Well, now i'm on the 3rd day of coding and it's growing and growing. This site was created using the ATOM IDE, which has been really useful, and is very good for people who like customization. The link to it is <a target="_blank" href="https://atom.io/">here.</a></p>

                        <p>This is going to be a large project, and I'm doing this to practice coding in HTML before I finish my course, in order to see what I can accomplish on my own without being taught. Therefore, it might take longer to complete (in my eyes) than it should, but I would prefer that I do this on my own. This is more of a test of my current skill level than an actual project to show off, but if it turns out rather well, of course I'm going to show it off.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of being proud, this website is also going to be a Columbia fanpage. If you look to your right, you'll find links to the SEAS (aka better) website, and also the Columbia College website, both the undergrad pages and the main pages.</p>
